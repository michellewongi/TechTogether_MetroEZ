## Overview
We worked in a team of 4 for this project. Our mobile and web app helps New Yorkers and tourists effectively navigate the subway system with our easy-to-use interface. By downloading our app or using our website, the user can check a regularly updated heat map of the New York City subway system to see live location updates of how crowded a particular train is, the condition of the station and train, and if there is an issue with a train or station. As the MTA has limited resources, they will be able to use the data that MetroEZ collects to determine which stations have the most foot-traffic, and invest in maintenance and accessibility in the stations that need it the most.

### The challenge

- Unfamiliarity with syncing the frontend to the backend.
- Working with React.js was intimidating because I wasn't very familiar with React.
